### Third Year Assignments
This repo contains all the assignment codes so that collaborating, helping out and plain having a place to get crash code from the night before submission deadlines gets easier.   
  
Simply create a "Assignment N" folder if it doesn't exist, create a folder under your name and add your codes.   

It would be **super helpful if you added a README to your folder** as well so that its easier to understand the code, or at least how to go about running it!!  

### Thank you for collaborating!
