### Third Year Assignments
This repo contains the assignments given in BCSE-3 JU.
  
Simply create a "Assignment N" folder if it doesn't exist, create a folder under your name and add your codes.   

It would be **super helpful if you added a README to your folder** as well so that its easier to understand the code, or at least on how to run it.

Feel free to create issues and/or pull requests in case of mistakes.

### Thank you for collaborating!
