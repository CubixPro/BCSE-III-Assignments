#### Guide to Run the scripts

* After downloading the folder you have to give the scrips executable permission to run.
    For linux you can give individual file executable permission using `chmod` command
    ```
    sudo chmod +x /path/to/the/file
    ```
    `only filename will do if you are in same directory`</br></br>
    Or you can give the whole directory executable permission recursively
    ```
    sudo chmod -R +x /path/to/the/directory
    ```
* Now run the scripts using `./filename` command. Ex:
  ```
  ./script1.sh
  ```
