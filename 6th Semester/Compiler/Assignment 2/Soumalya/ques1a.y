/*
Design a grammar to recognise a string of the form "aa...abb...b", i.e. any number of "a"s followed by any number of "b"s. Would it be better to use Lex or Yacc to recognise it? 
Lex: 

  a+b+
Yacc e.g.: 

  a_b	: as bs ;
  as	: 'a' | as 'a' ;
  bs	: 'b' | bs 'b' ;
I think the Lex version is much simpler, so I would use Lex.
